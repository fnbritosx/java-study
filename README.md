# Java Study 📚

Welcome! This repository contains my Java learning progress based on the YouTube course **"Maratona Java"** by *Desenvolvedor Dojo*.

I'm documenting the exercises and concepts learned in each class, keeping the code clean and in English to also improve my language skills.

## 📌 What's in here?

- Java basics: variables, types, operators
- Control structures: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, etc.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exercises and explanations

Each class (`Class01`, `Class02`, etc.) represents a topic from the course and includes practical code examples.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 About me

I'm currently learning Java and improving my English through hands-on practice.  
Feel free to explore the code, follow my progress, or suggest improvements!
